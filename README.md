# F1 Win Probability Predictor
# 🏁 F1 Win Probability Predictor

This project predicts the **winning probability of F1 drivers** using historical race data and machine learning. It’s built with **Python**, powered by a trained ML model (`f1_model.pkl`), and visualized through a **Streamlit web app**.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- ✅ Predicts F1 driver win probabilities based on race data
- 🧠 Uses a trained ML model on rich F1 datasets (lap times, qualifying, races, etc.)
- 📊 Clean and interactive Streamlit interface
- 🔗 Modular structure with reusable data files and model logic

---

## 🧱 Dataset Files

You'll find several `.csv` files including:
- `drivers.csv`, `races.csv`, `lap_times.csv`, `qualifying.csv`, etc.
- These are sourced from the [Ergast Developer API F1 dataset](https://ergast.com/mrd/)
